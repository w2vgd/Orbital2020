## Motivation 
Statistics suggest that many Singaporean students are unsure of their course of interest and prospective career paths prior to entering University. For some, doubts towards the course they undertake carry on to University. This leads to some potentially changing course midway, delaying graduation and wasting unnecessary time that could have been avoided with more informed career choices.

Furthermore, we find that many students do not have the proper connections or platform to share and receive guidance about university courses or career options by experienced personnel. Internet platforms like Google are unable to personalise their response to properly address the student concerns, especially since people have unique concerns that will be difficult to generalise.

Often, there are many willing to share their experiences but are not empowered with a platform to offer assistance.

## Aim 
We aim to bridge the gap between people in need of educational/career advice with experts in the respective fields, as well as people with similar experiences that may be able to offer appropriate and targeted guidance through an IOS app.


## User Stories
1. As an individual looking to find out more about a university course, I want to talk to students currently in the course to better understand their highs and lows in the course, and clarify my doubts about it.

2. As an aspiring individual in a certain field, I want to explore career options in that field and gain advice from experts to better transition into the career.

3. As someone who wants to help aspiring individuals, and who has abundant knowledge and experience in a certain field, I want to be able to answer questions, share my experiences and be connected to them.

4. As an administrator who wants to prevent inappropriate usage of the application, I want to be able to identify irrelevant posts, warn and ban such users if they continue to abuse the system.
